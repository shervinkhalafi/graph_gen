"""Diffusion components for discrete and continuous graph generation.

The pipeline composes three kinds of object:

- **NoiseSchedule** precomputes ``beta``, ``alpha``, and ``alpha_bar`` tensors
  that control how quickly signal decays over ``T`` diffusion steps.
- **NoiseProcess** (categorical or continuous) applies forward noise and
  computes VLB terms. Categorical processes own their stationary PMFs and
  reverse-process math directly.
- **Sampler** runs the reverse diffusion loop, denoising from the limit
  distribution back to clean graphs.

X_class / E_class synthesis convention: see
``docs/specs/2026-04-27-x-class-synth-unification-spec.md``.
