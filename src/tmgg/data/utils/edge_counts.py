"""Sparse edge / node class counters for empirical π estimation.

The two counters here are direct ports of upstream DiGress's
``AbstractDatasetInfos.edge_counts`` and ``AbstractDatasetInfos.node_types``
(``digress-upstream-readonly/src/datasets/abstract_dataset.py:34-72``).
The point of porting them rather than computing the same statistics on
our densified ``GraphData`` representation is grep-friendly parity:
auditors comparing the two codebases see the same algorithm in both.

The hot training loop is unchanged and still consumes dense
``GraphData``. These helpers are only used during datamodule setup, on
the *raw* PyG batches that sit one layer below the densification
collator.

    """Count one-hot edge-class occurrences across a PyG batch.

    Mirrors upstream DiGress's
    :meth:`AbstractDatasetInfos.edge_counts`
    (``digress-upstream-readonly/src/datasets/abstract_dataset.py:48-72``).
    For each per-graph node count ``c`` in the batch, the total number of
    ordered node pairs is ``c * (c - 1)``. The implicit "no-edge" count
    is the difference between the sum of those pair counts and the
    actual number of directed edges in ``edge_index``. Per-class edge
    counts come from summing ``edge_attr`` (one-hot) over the edge
    dimension and discarding the no-edge slot at index 0.

    Self-loops are stripped before counting, mirroring our densification
    path which removes them in :func:`GraphData.from_pyg_batch` (parity
    fix #2 / D-1).

    Parameters
    ----------
    pyg_batch
        A PyG batch yielded by ``Batch.from_data_list``. May expose
        ``edge_attr`` of shape ``(num_edges, num_edge_classes)`` (one-hot
        per edge, with index 0 reserved for "no edge"). When absent, we
        assume the binary-edge convention used throughout the
        SBM/synthetic pipeline: every edge is class 1.
    num_edge_classes
        Number of edge classes including the implicit "no-edge" class at
        index 0.
