"""Field identifiers and loss-kind dispatch for unified GraphData tensors.

Declares the canonical field names (node/edge/graph class and feature
streams) and the loss kind each field dispatches to, shared across
datasets, models, and losses under the Wave 0 unified GraphData
refactor.

The ``y_class`` and ``y_feat`` entries (parity #27 / #44 / D-13) cover
graph-level (global) targets, mirroring upstream DiGress's per-graph
``y`` tensor and its ``loss_y`` cross-entropy term in
``digress-upstream-readonly/src/metrics/train_metrics.py:62-123``. The
unified GraphData carries the underlying tensor on ``y``; the per-field
loss loop reads it via the field-name dispatch in ``DiffusionModule``.
With the default ``lambda_y = 0.0`` the y-term contributes nothing to
training loss, preserving structure-only SBM behaviour bit-for-bit.
