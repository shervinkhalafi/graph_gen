"""Per-step PMF / sample snapshots from the reverse sampling loop.

Hooked into :meth:`tmgg.diffusion.sampler.Sampler.sample` as an optional
side-effect, the :class:`ChainRecorder` captures the post-symmetrisation
``z_t`` for the first ``num_chains_to_save`` graphs of the batch on
every Kth reverse step. After the loop completes the recorder
:meth:`finalize` returns a dict suitable for ``torch.save`` whose schema
is documented in
``docs/specs/2026-04-22-upstream-config-surface-a.md``.

The recorder is deliberately separate from the existing
:class:`tmgg.diffusion.collectors.StepMetricCollector` (per spec
resolution Q1): metrics aggregate scalars per step, the recorder
snapshots full per-position categorical PMFs across many steps. They
have different lifetimes and different output schemas.

Per the spec resolutions (2026-04-22):

* **Q3** -- accumulate snapshots on GPU during the reverse loop. The
  caller pays the device-to-host transfer cost once at
  :meth:`finalize`.
* **Q4** -- snapshots are taken **post-symmetrisation**, after the
  sampler's ``triu+symmetrize`` site (matches upstream DiGress).
* **Q5** -- when the recorder is wired through a
  :class:`~tmgg.diffusion.noise_process.CompositeNoiseProcess`, snapshot
  keys are prefixed with the sub-process name (e.g.
  ``categorical/E_class``). The sampler-side wiring composes one
  recorder per sub-process and merges the snapshots back into a single
  artefact at finalisation.

Storage schema (single dict, written via ``torch.save``):

                                     ``snapshot_step_interval``,
                                     ``noise_process``, ``ema_active``);
                                     stored unprefixed even when
                                     ``field_prefix`` namespaces other
                                     keys, so a single artefact carries
                                     one global provenance record
================  =================  =====================================

``S`` is the number of recorded snapshots, ``C`` the configured
``num_chains_to_save``. Field-prefixed keys (``<prefix>/<field>``) carry
the same semantics under a sub-process namespace.

class ChainRecorder:
    """Capture per-step PMF / sample snapshots from the reverse loop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_chains_to_save
        Number of graphs from the front of the batch to track. Must be
        ``>= 1``; the "0 disables capture" mode is handled at the
        orchestration layer (the runner refrains from constructing a
        recorder).
    snapshot_step_interval
        Cadence in *reverse-loop steps*. ``maybe_record`` captures at
        ``step_index == 0`` and at every ``step_index % interval == 0``
        thereafter, plus the final step. Must be ``>= 1``. The naming
        deliberately differs from upstream's ``number_chain_steps``;
        upstream picks the write *index* via
        ``(s_int * number_chain_steps) // T``, ours simply samples every
        Kth reverse step. The two coincide for the common case of
        ``T == K * number_chain_steps``.
    meta
        Provenance dict written verbatim into ``finalize()`` output
        under the ``"meta"`` key. Required at construction (no default)
        per CLAUDE.md fail-loud spirit -- callers must explicitly
        decide what to record. Per spec D-16a Resolutions Q5 the
        canonical shape carries ``global_step``, ``epoch``, ``T``,
        ``snapshot_step_interval``, ``noise_process`` (qualname
        string), and ``ema_active``. The dict is shallow-copied at
        construction so post-construction mutations on the caller's
        copy do not affect the recorded artefact.
    field_prefix
        Optional namespace prefix for the snapshot keys. When the
        recorder is wired through a
        :class:`~tmgg.diffusion.noise_process.CompositeNoiseProcess`,
        the sampler instantiates one recorder per sub-process with that
        sub-process's name as the prefix (e.g. ``"categorical"``) so
        the final dict carries ``categorical/E_chain`` etc. Empty
        string (the default) emits unprefixed keys. The ``"meta"`` key
        is **not** prefixed; provenance is one global record per
        artefact.

    ------
    ValueError
