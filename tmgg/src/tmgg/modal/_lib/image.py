"""Modal image builder for TMGG experiments.

Provides a single ``create_tmgg_image`` function that builds a Modal
image with TMGG, PyTorch, and all evaluation dependencies (graph-tool,
ORCA, POT). Uses ``Image.micromamba()`` as the base so binary-heavy
packages are solved in one Conda environment instead of mixing Conda
and pip native runtimes.
