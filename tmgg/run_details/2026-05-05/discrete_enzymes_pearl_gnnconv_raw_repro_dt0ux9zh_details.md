**Health:** ✗ blew up — same divergence signature as the SBM-side runs `qao36vwu` and `g1g6xpx1`.

## Anchor comparison

> Computed against the cached train↔test baseline at `data/eval/mmd_baselines/pyg_enzymes.json` (see [`docs/eval/mmd-units-and-protocol.md`](../../docs/eval/mmd-units-and-protocol.md) for unit semantics). All MMD values are V-statistic squared MMD (GraphRNN/GRAN convention).

- `r_run` = MMD²(gen-val, this run) / MMD²(train, test).
- `r_higen` = HiGen Table 1's reported MMD² for DiGress on this dataset, divided by our baseline. Expresses HiGen's reproduction in our pipeline's ratio units.
- `r_paper` = DiGress paper Table 1 ratio, verbatim. ENZYMES: paper has no ENZYMES — column blank.

| metric | run mmd² | baseline mmd² | r_run | r_higen | r_paper |
|--------|---------:|--------------:|------:|--------:|--------:|
| degree     | 0.2113 | 2.9976e-04 | 704.89 | 13.34 | n/a |
| clustering | 0.0942 | 1.0443e-02 | 9.02 | 7.95 | n/a |
| orbit      | 0.5380 | 1.7318e-04 | 3106.56 | 11.55 | n/a |
| spectral   | 0.1954 | 2.8479e-03 | 68.61 | n/a | n/a |

**Caveat:** run-side MMD is gen↔val; baseline is train↔test. [`PICKUP-MMD-RATIOS-2026-05-06.md`](../../PICKUP-MMD-RATIOS-2026-05-06.md) Task 3 §2 flags this. Effect likely O(1) given i.i.d. splits, but a train↔val baseline would tighten the comparison.

## Visuals

- none — would not be diagnostic on a divergent run.

## Notes

R-PEARL features + `BareGraphConv` Q/K/V (raw, un-normalised adjacency).

**Confirms the cross-dataset finding from the SBM side:** un-normalised `BareGraphConv` Q/K/V is numerically unstable. Both SBM runs (`qao36vwu`, `g1g6xpx1`) and this enzymes run all show grad_norm in the 1e3–1e18 range and effective_lr at 1e-3 or higher. The `_norm_` sister variant uses normalised adjacency and stays stable on both datasets.

The clustering MMD 0.094 looks superficially good, but is meaningless on a run that has clearly diverged on the other metrics — do not cite.

**Action:** kill, fix (normalisation + gradient clipping + lower lr), or document-as-known-broken. See `runlog.md` "Backfill checklist" item 8.
