"""Reader helpers for the async-eval manifest.

The async-eval architecture (plan: ``compressed-tumbling-whale``) has
two writers record per-step events at
``/data/outputs/{run_id}/eval_manifest.d/`` (or, in legacy runs,
``eval_manifest.jsonl``): the trainer-side ``AsyncEvalSpawnCallback``
emits ``status: spawned`` when it fires a Modal eval call, and the
eval worker emits ``status: completed`` or ``status: failed`` when it
finishes.

Layout — directory of immutable per-row files (preferred)
---------------------------------------------------------

::

    eval_manifest.d/
      0000200-spawned-fc01KQDxyz.json
      0000200-completed-evalworker-<uuid>.json
      0000800-spawned-fc01KQDabc.json
      0000800-failed-evalworker-<uuid>.json

Filename: ``{scheduled_step:07d}-{status}-{discriminator}.json``.
The zero-padded step makes filename-sort = step-sort. Each file is
written once, never appended; cross-container concurrency is solved
by giving each writer a distinct filename. ``latest_status_per_step``
picks the highest-priority status per step
(``completed`` > ``failed`` > ``spawned``) so a still-pending eval
doesn't shadow a later terminal row.

Layout — single JSONL file (legacy)
-----------------------------------

Older runs wrote append-only JSONL at ``eval_manifest.jsonl`` with a
leading ``{"kind": "schema", "version": 1, ...}`` row. ``read_manifest``
auto-detects this layout and falls through to JSONL parsing for
audit-trail back-compat. New writes always use the directory layout.

Three downstream callers consume these helpers:

- ``fetch_outcomes.py`` cross-references the manifest with W&B history
  to decide whether all expected eval steps are accounted for before
  emitting ``threshold_pass``.
- ``watch_runs.py`` reads ``evals_lag`` to flag eval-starvation, which
  the recommendation flowchart uses to broaden ``extend_watch`` over
  ``kill: saturation``.
- ``reconcile_evals.py`` walks ``status: spawned`` files whose Modal
  call has since terminated and writes the missing terminal file.

Manifest row schema (per the plan)::

    {"kind": "eval_event",
     "run_uid": "smallest-cfg/spectre_sbm/r1/anchor/aabbccdd",
     "wandb_run_id": "abc1234",
     "scheduled_step": 5237,
     "global_step": 5240,
     "ts_utc": "2026-04-29T...",
     "status": "spawned" | "completed" | "failed",
     "modal_call_id": "fc-...",
     "checkpoint_path": "/data/outputs/{run_id}/checkpoints/step_5240.ckpt",
     "metrics": {"gen-val/sbm_accuracy": 0.62, ...} | null,
     "error_tail": null | "..."}

``scheduled_step`` and ``global_step`` differ when
``accumulate_grad_batches > 1`` skips the exact scheduled step; the
eval fires at the first step >= scheduled. ``scheduled_step`` is the
key used for completeness — it matches the schedule the trainer was
given.
