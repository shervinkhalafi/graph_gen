# Repro panel ablations — MMDs vs paper anchors

Snapshot: **2026-05-06 20:13 UTC**.

Single-page measurement summary across the SBM and ENZYMES `_repro`
panels: per-step MMD trajectories, last-cycle headline values,
ratios against the train↔test baseline, and ratio comparisons to
DiGress paper Table 1 and HiGen Table 1.

All MMD values are V-statistic squared MMD² (gen↔val for runs,
train↔test for baselines), per the GraphRNN/GRAN convention. Unit
semantics: see [`docs/eval/mmd-units-and-protocol.md`](mmd-units-and-protocol.md).
For the prior detailed analysis (caveats, GDPO-vs-Vignac config drift,
reproduction caveats), see [`2026-05-06-mmd-ratio-analysis.md`](2026-05-06-mmd-ratio-analysis.md).

## Anchors

- **DiGress paper** (Vignac et al., ICLR 2023): Table 1 reports
  `r = MMD²(gen, test) / MMD²(train, test)`. Has SBM, no ENZYMES.
- **HiGen paper** (Karami, `arXiv:2305.19337`): Table 1 reports
  *raw* MMD² values for "DiGress" rows on both SBM and ENZYMES. We
  divide by our cached train↔test baseline to get HiGen-implied ratios
  in our pipeline's units.
- **Our baselines** (`data/eval/mmd_baselines/{spectre_sbm,pyg_enzymes}.json`,
  computed by `tmgg-mmd-baselines` on Modal 2026-05-06):
  - SBM: `degree=3.41e-04, clustering=3.31e-02, orbit=3.10e-02, spectral=2.82e-03`
  - ENZYMES: `degree=3.00e-04, clustering=1.04e-02, orbit=1.73e-04, spectral=2.85e-03`

### Anchor conversion via our measured baseline

The DiGress paper publishes only ratios, but their evaluation
protocol uses SPECTRE-SBM splits identical to ours (128 train / 32
val / 40 test). So multiplying `r_paper` by our measured train↔test
baseline gives the absolute MMD² we'd expect their generator to
produce on our pipeline:

```
anchor_abs = anchor_ratio × baseline_train_test
```

For HiGen this conversion is definitional — HiGen publishes raw
MMD² and we computed `r_higen` by *dividing* by our baseline, so
the conversion just recovers HiGen's published number. For DiGress
it's a faithful absolute under the matching-protocol assumption.

**SBM** (baseline computed 2026-05-06 by `tmgg-mmd-baselines`):

| metric     | baseline_train↔test (ours) | DiGress paper r | DiGress paper abs MMD² (= r × baseline) | HiGen r | HiGen abs MMD² (published) |
|------------|---------------------------:|----------------:|----------------------------------------:|--------:|---------------------------:|
| degree     | 3.41e-04 | 1.6 | 5.46e-04 | 3.81 | 1.30e-03 |

| orbit      | 3.10e-02 | 1.7 | 5.27e-02 | 1.40 | 4.34e-02 |
| spectral   | 2.82e-03 | n/a | n/a      | n/a  | n/a      |

**ENZYMES** (baseline computed 2026-05-06):

| metric     | baseline_train↔test (ours) | DiGress paper r | DiGress paper abs MMD² (= r × baseline) | HiGen r | HiGen abs MMD² (published) |
|------------|---------------------------:|----------------:|----------------------------------------:|--------:|---------------------------:|

| clustering | 1.04e-02 | n/a | n/a | 7.95  | 8.27e-02 |
| orbit      | 1.73e-04 | n/a | n/a | 11.55 | 2.00e-03 |
| spectral   | 2.85e-03 | n/a | n/a | n/a   | n/a      |

DiGress paper has no ENZYMES evaluation, so the paper-anchor column
is empty for that dataset.

¹ `e5pd9drt` is at step 75k only — only one eval cycle so far. Degree
may still be in the high-bias early phase.

² Post-fix runs all at cycle 1 only (trainer step ~22k = first eval).
Same caveat as ¹: degree and orbit have only one observation each, may
move noticeably in subsequent cycles. Pre-fix (mask-bug-invalidated)
rows show the trajectories are mostly flat after cycle 1, so these are
indicative of the panel basin but not final.

## Quick reads

1. **Mask fix did not move the panel basin.** Post-fix `vignac_repro_exact`
   at trainer step ~22k sits at degree 0.187 / clustering 0.135 / orbit
   0.091 / spectral 0.210, essentially the same MMD basin as the
   mask-bug-invalidated runs at the same early step. Conclusion: the
   diagonal-mask divergence was a correctness defect (state-dict
   non-equivalence to upstream), not the source of the published-anchor
   gap. The anchor gap survives the fix and must be explained by
   something else — kernel/sigma, undertraining, baseline-protocol
   drift, or a different bug entirely.
2. **Trajectories are flat after step 75k** (pre-fix data, mask-bug
   invalidated but useful as trend evidence). Every healthy variant
   plateaus at panel-floor MMDs by the first eval cycle and barely
   moves over the next 5–7 cycles. Post-fix we have 1–2 cycles per
   variant — too few to confirm the plateau survives the fix, but the
   first-cycle values land in the same range.
3. **Orbit is volatile cycle-to-cycle.** Within a single run, orbit
   can swing ~3× (e.g. `ge461v1o` 0.089 → 0.207 → 0.114; `4n28svrj`
   0.067 → 0.186 → 0.097). Post-fix `xsmz6yql` already shows 0.387 →
   0.531 across two cycles. Degree, clustering, spectral are stable
   to ≲15% across cycles. Headline reports must use min-or-mean over
   multiple cycles, not last-cycle.
4. **Clustering is calibrated.** SBM post-fix at 3.96–4.07 vs HiGen
   1.50 / paper 1.5 — same 2.6× gap as pre-fix. ENZYMES post-fix at
   9.30–10.23 vs HiGen 7.95 — 1.2× off, slightly tighter than pre-fix
   (9.91–11.30). The pearl_repro_exact 9.30 is the panel best on
   ENZYMES clustering. **HiGen ≡ paper on SBM clustering** — strong
   evidence the protocol is bandwidth-stable across implementations.
5. **Orbit on ENZYMES regressed early in post-fix data.** Pre-fix
   l1nk0622 hit 0.0538 by step 225k (best cycle); post-fix runs
   sit at 0.121–0.531 at step 75k–150k. Likely a combination of
   (a) only 1–2 cycles measured so far so we may be catching unlucky
   cycles in the high-volatility regime, and (b) post-fix runs are
   still in the early-bias phase. Re-evaluate after step 200k.
6. **Degree is still broken everywhere.** SBM post-fix 531–616× vs
   paper 1.6 (~330×); ENZYMES post-fix 601–727× vs HiGen 13.34
   (~46×). Same magnitude as pre-fix. Even HiGen's own degree ratio
   (3.81) was 2.4× off DiGress paper, so we're well past their gap.
   The small absolute baseline (3e-4) amplifies any absolute generation
   error; combined with apparent undertraining of the block-degree
   distribution. Mask fix did not touch this.
7. **Spectral has no anchor**, just a uniform 65–80× across both
   datasets and all healthy variants, pre- and post-fix. Suggestively
   flat — possible systematic histogram-bin/range mismatch vs upstream
   `spectral_stats` (PICKUP doc Task 3 §3).
8. **`_raw_` is unviable on both datasets.** Pre-fix SBM r_degree
   877/1269; ENZYMES r_orbit 3107. The variant was killed terminally
   2026-05-06 09:35–09:59 UTC and has no post-fix successor.
9. **GDPO-vs-`_exact` drift is now measurable.** Pre-fix
   `vignac_repro` (12s2b4a7) at step 75k: degree 0.200 / cluster 0.130
   / orbit 0.109 / spectral 0.216. Post-fix `vignac_repro_exact`
   (cgfv3f85) at step ~22k: degree 0.187 / cluster 0.135 / orbit 0.091
   / spectral 0.210. Different steps confound a clean comparison; the
   gap will become readable once cgfv3f85 reaches step 75k+.

## Best-per-metric across all healthy runs and all eval cycles

`gap` = best run raw MMD² ÷ tightest published anchor abs MMD² (i.e.
the smallest anchor between DiGress paper and HiGen, where both exist).

| SBM     | degree     | **0.1813** | `k4iiw5sg` / ~22k | 531 | 5.46e-04 (paper) | **332×** |

Reads from the post-fix gap column: SBM clustering and orbit are
within ~2–3× of an anchor — plausibly closeable. SBM degree is 332×
off; ENZYMES degree 45× and orbit 61×. Degree is the dominant
pathology on both datasets, and the mask-bug fix did not change the
order of magnitude. **Caveat: post-fix runs have 1–2 eval cycles
each so far; pre-fix trajectories show orbit can swing 3× per
cycle, so post-fix bests will tighten as more cycles land — but
degree, clustering, and spectral are stable cycle-to-cycle so those
gaps are unlikely to move much.**
